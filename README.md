# python-learning-of-the-data-and-AI

My learning of the AI and data in 2022 winter start from the data.
## Part zero
You will need some basic math knowledge like the linear algebra and the Probability Theory
### 1. 线性代数

## Part one the basic data operation

All the markdown file will have the relevant the .py file that is executable

[string operation](./basic/string_operation.md)

[time](./basic/time.md)

### 1.the basic DS

[list](./basic/List.md)

[tuple](./basic/tuple.md)

[dict](./basic/dict.md)

### 2.the grammar

[lambda](./basic/lamda.md)

### 3.the file op and the simple data process

## Part Two The part of the AI learning

### 1. the basic library

[numpy](AI/basic_lib/numpy_basic.md)
[pandas](AI/basic_lib/pandas_learn.md)
> pandas and the numpy are useful library that you can use to deal with you data

[matplotlib](AI/basic_lib/matpolib/simple_use.md)
> matplotlib is a library that provide you with many useful ways to draw the chart


## 2. the linear regression
[link](./AI/线性回归/linear_regression.md)


## 3. The decision tree
You can find the jupyter notebook and the training data in the folder named 决策树
