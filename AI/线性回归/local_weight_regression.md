# Locally weight regression

It is a non-parameters algorithm, and it grows with the size pf the problem	

Fit the $\theta$ to mininizw the $\sum_{i=1}^m w^i(y^i-\theta^Tx^i)^2$

Where $w^i$ is a weight function, $w^i$ =$ exp(-\frac{(x^i-x)^2}{t})$

If $|x^i - x|$ Is big, $w^i$  = 0

else it is 1

When the dismenon of the data is low and its size is bigm we can use it
