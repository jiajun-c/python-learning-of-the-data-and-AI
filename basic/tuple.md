# tuple
For most of the time, you can use the list to solve the things.
tuple is similar to the list, but in the tuple it is much faster 
because it is immutable. what's more, the tuple can contain 
the elem that are in different type

I nearly not use it...

## 1.create a tuple
```python
a = ("x","y","y")
```

## 2. unpack the tuple
```python
var1, var2, var3 = a
print("Out{},{},{}".format(var1,var2,var3))
```
you can find that the var... can get the value in the a

if you wants to turn the tuple to the list or the tuple to the list, you can 
use list(tuple)
